## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned some concepts during the project:

- box shadow
- inline and block elements 

### Continued development

I will be focussing on concepts like flexbox and CSS grid layout to make responsive designs which are compatible to different divices.
